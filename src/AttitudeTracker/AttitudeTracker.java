/* 
 * A Kalman filter designed for estimating the attitude (roll, pitch, yaw) of a FIRST sized robot.
 * 
 * Much of this code is credit Peter Abeles as example code for the EJM library at:
 * https://github.com/lessthanoptimal/ejm
 * 
 * Technically it would be sufficient to incorporate Peter's example as a member, but I feel this
 * more plagiaristic method is more effective.
 * 
 * This is meant to incorporate physical realities with the theoretical concepts of a Kalman filter.
